Recipe Mock Webpage for TOP

Herein lies the index page and three links to a recipe page. This is pure html, no CSS, making it a "brutalist" webpage. Maybe minimalist is a better adjective.

Each page is identical in design. It includes a header, which matches the title, then has an image of the dish with alt text, the ingridients and the rough steps to make the dish.

As far as the progress shown goes, I skipped over the instructions which said to commit every time I made a meaningful change to the code, so I committed just once, at the end.
